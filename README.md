## Arcade Game

This is a required project for my [Udacity Front End Nanodegree](https://github.com/udacity/fend) to demostrate knowledge of Object Oriented Programming. It is essentially a frogger clone using ES6 classes and a provided game engine to generate and move the characters. Any code that was provided is commented. Most of the code I contributed is in app.js.

_Note: In general I prefer to avoid classes and "this" where possible._

### Instructions

Nicolas cage is drowning! To win the game reach Nicholas Cage, but beware of the lady bugs! If they hit you you'll respawn at the start!
